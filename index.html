        <!-- About me section -->
        <br>
        Born on May 15, 1997, in the serene city of Lalitpur Thuladurlung, Nepal, I embarked on a journey that would
        shape my future. Growing up in this culturally rich environment, I developed a deep appreciation for knowledge
        and a curiosity to explore the world around me. <br><br>
        My educational journey began at Shree Bajra Barahi Higher Secondary School, where I completed my high school
        education. During those formative years, I discovered a passion for physics. The intricacies of the subject
        fascinated me, and I knew I wanted to delve deeper into its mysteries.
        With this aspiration in mind, I enrolled in Tri Chandra Multiple Campus, a prestigious institution renowned for
        its academic excellence. At the campus, I chose to major in physics, immersing myself in the world of equations,
        experiments, and scientific theories. I relished the challenges and the opportunity to expand my understanding
        of the universe. <br><br>
        However, in 2018, fate presented me with an unexpected opportunity. An invitation to the United States opened
        new doors and possibilities. Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore different horizons, I made
        the difficult decision to temporarily pause my bachelor's degree at Tri Chandra Multiple Campus.

        Stepping foot in the United States, I found myself in a completely new environment. Everything was different,
        from the culture to the language, and I faced various challenges in acclimating to this unfamiliar territory.
        Adjusting to the changes, I decided to dedicate the first year to acclimating to my new surroundings,
        understanding the local customs, and improving my language skills.

        As I settled into this new chapter of my life, I realized the importance of adapting and persevering in the face
        of adversity. I was determined not to let the circumstances hinder my pursuit of knowledge. In pursuit of my
        passion, I joined Richland College, where I decided to explore the field of computer science. <br><br>

        Enrolling as a computer science major, I embraced the world of coding, algorithms, and software development. The
        logical thinking required in computer science complemented my analytical mindset nurtured by my physics
        background. Through rigorous coursework, hands-on projects, and collaborative experiences, I honed my skills and
        discovered a new passion within the realm of technology.

        After completing my associate degree in computer science at Richland College in 2022, I was eager to continue my
        educational journey and broaden my horizons further. Guided by my unwavering commitment to learning, I made the
        decision to transfer to the University of Texas at Dallas, renowned for its excellence in computer science
        education.

        Now, as a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science,
        eagerly embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. I am excited to engage in advanced
        coursework, collaborate with fellow passionate individuals, and delve deeper into the world of computer science.
        <br> <br>

        My journey from Nepal to the United States has shaped me into a resilient and adaptable individual. It has
        taught me the value of embracing change, pursuing my passions, and overcoming obstacles along the way. With each
        step, I have grown academically, intellectually, and personally, and I am grateful for the opportunities that
        have come my way.

        As I strive to earn my bachelor's degree in computer science, I am filled with a sense of anticipation and
        determination. I am confident that the skills, knowledge, and experiences I gain throughout this journey will
        empower me to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of technology and make a positive impact on the
        world around me.
